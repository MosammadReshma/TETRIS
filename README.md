# TETRIS
I'm new to coding and am still learning. So I will be honest; I did use AI; so whenever I had doubts or wanted to add a feature but didn't know how, It used to teach me. This project was a practice for whatever I learned so far and exposing myself to building new things. I did learn new things from this project. Even though it is small, I think it is a decent project for a beginner
