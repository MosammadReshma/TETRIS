# TETRIS
I'm new to coding and am still learning. So I will be honest; I did use AI. chat gpt was my mentor, so whenever I had doubts or wanted to add a feature but didn't know how, It used to teach me. This project was a practice for whatever I learned so farand exposing myself to building new things. I did learn a lot from this project. Even though it is small, it is a decent project
